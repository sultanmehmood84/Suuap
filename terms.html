    						<h2 class="sp-main_title"> Terms and Conditions ("Terms") </h2>
    						<p> <u> Last updated: November, 2018 </u> <br><br>
    						Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before
using the www.suuap.com website and the Suuap mobile application (the "Service") operated
by Suuap Inc. ( “app”, "us", "we", or "our"). <br><br>
   						 Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to everyone who access or use the Service. <br><br>
<strong>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree
with any part of the terms then you may not have access to the Service.</strong>    						 
    						</p>
    						
    						<p>
    							<strong>1.</strong> By using the Service, you consent to receive calls, texts, e-mails, notifications, and
notices on or from the Service. You also consent to our collection, use, disclosure, retention,
and protection of your personal information (more in Privacy Notice). <br><br>
<strong>2.</strong> A Suuap account is necessary to fully utilize the Service. The verification process must
be completed by you to fully activate your account. A verified and valid payment method is not
necessary to use the Service; however, it is necessary to have a verified and valid payment
method in order to buy and sell (“Exchange”) through the Service. <br><br>
<strong>3.</strong> You are the sole responsible party for protecting the confidentiality of your account and
password. You are also responsible for all the activities that occur under your account. <br><br>
<strong>4.</strong> Suuap does not sell and deliver product to anyone. We are a marketplace platform
where we bring college students (“Parties”) to Exchange for their items. We are here to connect
the Parties and we currently do not handle payment transactions for the Exchange. Parties are
responsible for the delivery of the products and the payment between the Parties. We do not
provide any return service. <br><br>
<strong>5.</strong> Minors under the age of 16 are not allowed on the Service. Minors who are age 16 and
above may use Service, but they must have a parent or legal guardian manage their accounts,
payments or transaction on the Service. The Service is use for anyone who is at least age 18. <br><br>
<strong>6.</strong> You can post reviews, comments, and communicate with other users on the Service as
long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, and inappropriate. <br><br>
<strong>7.</strong> You are responsible for the accuracy and content of the listing item offered. You must
not post any digital files/documents, digital codes, eBooks, false, inaccurate, and misleading
content which include pricing or list price. Failure to do so may result in account suspension or
termination.
